# Relationship Forecast — Pretty Static Site (TikTok-ready)

This is a mobile-first, pastel-styled MVP of **Relationship Forecast** optimized for TikTok virality.

## What you get
- `index.html` — landing page, short quiz, and combined forecast card.
- `style.css` — pastel theme, heart-friendly design, mobile-first layout.
- `script.js` — two-partner quiz logic + friendly result generation.
- `README.md` — this file with publishing notes.
- `LICENSE` — MIT.

## Recommended quick publish (free)
**GitHub Pages** (no cost):
1. Create a GitHub repo (e.g., `relationship-forecast`).
2. Upload these files to the repo.
3. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch `main` → root `/` → Save.
4. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/relationship-forecast/` after a minute.

## Next improvements (optional)
- Add `html2canvas` to enable PNG downloads for shareable cards.
- Integrate Stripe for a paid "Deep Forecast" PDF (server-side PDF generation required).
- Add simple analytics (Netlify or Google Analytics) and a consent/privacy banner for GDPR compliance.
